# Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction

This we app is created to predict the chronic kidney disease using the data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The dataset contains various parameters like age, blood pressure, specific gravity, albumin, sugar, red blood cells, pus cell, pus cell clumps, bacteria, blood glucose random, blood urea, serum creatinine, sodium, potassium, hemoglobin, packed cell volume, white blood cell count, red blood cell count, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, appetite, pedal edema, anemia, and class.

The dataset is used to build a machine learning model to predict the chronic kidney disease based on the input parameters.
